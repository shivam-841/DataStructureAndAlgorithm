Approach: Move n-1 disc from A to B 
          Move one largest disc from A to C
          Move n-1 disc from B to C

Code :
    long long sum=0;
    long long toh(int n, int from, int to, int aux) {
        if(n==0) return sum;
        toh(n-1,from,aux,to);
        cout<<"move disk "<<n<<" from rod "<<from<<" to rod "<<to<<endl;
        sum++;
        toh(n-1,aux,to,from);
    }

Note : the cout statement also moving one disc so be careful if you have to use this in another questions

Time Complexity: O(2^n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
